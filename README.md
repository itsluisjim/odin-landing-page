# odin-landing-page
This webpage is one of The odin projects exercises. 

It is divided in 5 sections, the hero , the card section, the quote section, the call to action section, and the footer.

The theme of this webpage is star wars.

It took me about a week to finish this, it was tough at times but definitely getting better by the minute.

I hope you like it! 

May the force be with you :)
